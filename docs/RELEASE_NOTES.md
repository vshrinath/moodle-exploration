## [2026-02-21] — Team handover documentation and Phase 3 validation

### What changed
- Added comprehensive getting started guide for new team members with 45-minute onboarding path
- Documented all known system limitations with workarounds and future enhancement recommendations
- Added Phase 3 test report validating cohort lifecycle, enrollment methods, and regression checks
- Documented enrollment method behavior (manual vs. cohort sync) in workflow guide
- Added artifacts directory with test evidence from Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation
- Tagged release as v1.0.0-handover milestone

### Why
System is production-ready for Allied Health Foundational course workflow. New team members need clear onboarding path, known limitations documentation prevents confusion, and test evidence provides confidence in system stability. Enrollment method findings are critical for production cohort management.

### Files touched
- `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` — New team member onboarding guide
- `docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` — System constraints and workarounds
- `docs/PHASE_3_COHORT_LIFECYCLE_TEST_REPORT.md` — Phase 3 validation results
- `docs/ALLIED_HEALTH_FOUNDATIONAL_COURSE_WORKFLOW.md` — Added enrollment method behavior section
- `artifacts/README.md` — Test artifacts documentation
- `artifacts/allied-health-e2e/` — Phase 2 and Phase 3 test evidence (screenshots, reports)

---

## [2026-02-21] — In-app Help page, completion tracking, stream progress UX

### What changed
- **Help page**: Role-aware FAQ page at `/local/sceh_rules/help.php` with accordion sections. Learners see course/progress help, trainers see teaching help, sysadmins see admin help. "Help" link injected into primary nav bar.
- **Completion tracking**: Setup script enables site-wide tracking and configures smart defaults (quiz→grade, resource→view, assign→submit, others→manual). Existing 38 activities updated across all courses.
- **Stream Progress**: Removed "No stream selected" notice. Added guidance text explaining how to complete activities. Activity cards are now clickable — each links directly to the quiz/resource view page.
- **My Competencies**: Card now links to course competencies instead of learning plans.
- **FAQ docs**: USER_FAQ.md and SYSTEM_FAQ.md fully rewritten to reflect current system state.

### Why
The system should be self-explanatory. Help page gives users role-specific guidance without leaving the app. Completion tracking makes progress pages functional. Clickable cards reduce friction. Updated FAQs prevent confusion from stale references to removed features.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_rules/help.php` — [NEW] Role-aware help/FAQ page
- `scripts/config/configure_completion_tracking.php` — [NEW] Idempotent completion tracking setup
- `local_sceh_rules/stream_progress.php` — Removed notice, added guidance, added activity URLs
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/output/sceh_card.php` — URL support in list item renderer
- `local_sceh_rules/lang/en/local_sceh_rules.php` — Added help_title and guidance strings
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — My Competencies link fix, Help nav injection
- `docs/USER_FAQ.md` — Full rewrite for current state
- `docs/SYSTEM_FAQ.md` — Updated with nav, completion, help system info

## [2026-02-21] — Dashboard UX parity: cleanup all roles, hide nav clutter

### What changed
- **Learner**: Removed 4 placeholder cards (Case Logbook, Attendance, Credentialing Sheet, Video Library). Reordered remaining 5 cards by priority. Added count badges on Upcoming Deadlines and My Badges. Flat grid layout with no section headings.
- **Trainer**: Consolidated individual course cards into single expandable "My Courses" card using PO's sub-action pattern. Single course links directly, multiple courses expand a sub-action bar. Removed stream sub-cards.
- **Sysadmin**: Removed Attendance Reports card (trainer concern). Reordered 6 cards by priority. Dropped duplicate cohort count from status row (now 3 cards: Cron Tasks, Active Users, Overdue Events).
- **All roles**: Hidden "Dashboard" and "My courses" from header nav (SCEH logo is the home link). Hidden Workflow Queue for initial rollout (single line uncomment to restore).

### Why
Dashboard cards should be actionable, not placeholders. Each role now sees only cards relevant to their workflow, in priority order. Header cleanup reduces cognitive load for new users. Workflow Queue hidden until users are comfortable with the core dashboard.

### Files touched
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Role-specific card cleanup, reordering, expandable course pattern, count badges, workflow queue disabled
- `block_sceh_dashboard/lang/en/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Added `trainermycourses` string
- `block_sceh_dashboard/styles.css` — Hidden primary nav items, mobile grid tweaks

## [2026-02-19] — Remove Django-specific drift from local skills and align to Moodle/PHP

### What changed
- Cleaned local `skills/` content to remove Django-specific references that were misleading for this repository.
- Replaced framework-specific examples and wording with Moodle/PHP-relevant guidance in security, debugging, API/data/performance, and ops references.
- Kept generic principles intact while making examples and stack assumptions consistent with current Moodle workflow execution.

### Why
The repository now uses a Moodle 5 plugin-centric workflow. Django-specific examples in shared skills caused context drift and could lead to incorrect implementation/test decisions. This update keeps skills actionable for current team usage.

### Files touched
- `skills/INDEX.md` — Updated framework wording in index notes
- `skills/README.md` — Updated language-stack/deployment guidance for PHP/Moodle context
- `skills/coding/guard.md` — Replaced Django security examples with Moodle/PHP-style examples
- `skills/coding/debugging.md` — Updated debugging references for Moodle/PHP stack
- `skills/coding/api-design.md` — Replaced Django-themed sample payload/search terms
- `skills/coding/data-modeling.md` — Removed Django-specific wording/examples in framework notes
- `skills/coding/performance.md` — Removed Django-specific framework examples/links
- `skills/meta/confidence-scoring.md` — Updated confidence examples to Moodle context
- `skills/meta/context-strategy.md` — Updated cached stack example to Moodle/MariaDB/Docker
- `skills/meta/error-recovery.md` — Updated recovery examples to Moodle-style failures
- `skills/ops/deployment-practices.md` — Removed Django-specific deploy references
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-19] — Add and align local skills library for Moodle workflow execution

### What changed
- Added a broader local `skills/` library for coding, quality, ops, product decomposition, and autonomous execution support.
- Updated core implementation/testing skills to reflect this Moodle setup:
  - `@dev`: Moodle plugin APIs, script patterns, Docker execution defaults
  - `@qa`: workflow-first validation using `scripts/config`, `scripts/verify`, and `scripts/test`
  - `@frontend-perf`: Moodle block/plugin frontend constraints and AMD-focused guidance
  - `@performance`: Moodle backend/plugin performance priorities
- Expanded skill index and README for discoverability and cross-skill sequencing.

### Why
Workflow simulation, role-based validation, and plugin-centric changes now drive day-to-day development in this repository. Skill guidance needed to match the actual Moodle stack and execution model so implementation and testing decisions remain consistent across contributors/tools.

### Files touched
- `skills/INDEX.md` — Added index and workflow mapping for local skills
- `skills/README.md` — Added skills system overview and usage patterns
- `skills/coding/dev.md` — Added Moodle project profile and execution defaults
- `skills/coding/qa.md` — Added Moodle-specific testing layers and role/workflow checks
- `skills/coding/frontend-performance.md` — Added Moodle frontend profile for performance work
- `skills/coding/performance.md` — Added Moodle backend profile for performance work
- `skills/*` (additional coding/meta/ops/product files) — Added supporting skill references
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-19] — Implement Advanced Deep-Linking and High-Fidelity Backend Redesign

### What changed
- **Advanced Drill-Down (Phase 6)**: Enhanced `stream_setup_check.php` with `categoryid` and `filter=issues` parameters. Dashboard now automatically scopes navigational links to a single assigned category if detected.
- **Dashboard Cleanup (Phase 7)**: Removed "Manage Cohorts" quick action from the Program Owner dashboard to focus the role on curriculum and content management.
- **Premium Backend Restyling (Phase 8)**: Implemented a global SCEH-branded surface background with radial gradients for administrative pages. Restyled primary/secondary buttons, hero-style headings, and enhanced `#region-main` with soft shadows and increased padding for a "dashboard-like" look and feel across core Moodle pages.
- **Improved Filter Logic**: Added automatic issue filtering for "Needs Changes" dashboard cards.

### Why
Advanced deep-linking reduces navigational friction by allowing Program Owners to jump directly to filtered issue lists. Removing redundant administrative actions (Cohorts) streamlines the user experience. The high-fidelity redesign provides a premium, cohesive brand experience that bridges the gap between the custom dashboard and Moodle's administrative backend.

### Files touched
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Implemented category scoping and removed Manage Cohorts action.
- `block_sceh_dashboard/styles.css` — Added high-fidelity backend restyling and premium CSS variables.
- `local_sceh_rules/stream_setup_check.php` — Added category and issue filtering logic.
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-19] — Audit Program Owner dashboard and implement UX enhancements

### What changed
- Renamed "Courses/Programs" card to **"Courses"** in dashboard status cards for better model alignment.
- Relaxed permission checks in `local_sceh_rules` and `local_sceh_importer` to support category-level Program Owner roles.
- Implemented intelligent deep-linking for draft and "Needs Changes" statuses, pointing directly to course settings if only a single item is involved.
- Applied "organic" visual polish to Moodle administrative pages (course edit, participants) to match the SCEH dashboard aesthetic.
- Updated Allied Health workflow automation to include Program Owner visibility control validation.

### Why
Initial audit revealed that category-scoped Program Owners were blocked by system-level capability checks on custom pages. Navigation was also too generic, requiring multiple clicks to reach actionable items. Visual integration improves perceived quality and reduces cognitive load during backend transitions.

### Files touched
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Renamed status label, implemented deep-linking logic, and added category-issue helper
- `block_sceh_dashboard/lang/en/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Updated string for "Courses"
- `block_sceh_dashboard/styles.css` — Added organic backend integration styles
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Relaxed permission check for category Program Owners
- `local_sceh_rules/stream_setup_check.php` — Relaxed permission check and supported direct course links
- `scripts/test/test_allied_health_quiz_workflow.php` — Validated Program Owner visibility control in workflow automation
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

## [2026-02-19] — Add Allied Health workflow spec update and shared test content package

### What changed
- Updated the Allied Health foundational workflow document to the current week/day operating model and automation input guidance.
- Added test content package assets for Allied Health workflow simulation (`test_content/`) including day-wise content, lesson plans, roleplay files, and quiz CSVs.

### Why
Testers and backend engineers need a shared, reproducible package and a single updated workflow spec to run consistent end-to-end validation before staging/production onboarding.

### Files touched
- `docs/ALLIED_HEALTH_FOUNDATIONAL_COURSE_WORKFLOW.md` — Updated workflow details and test input guidance
- `test_content/` — Added Allied Health sample content and templates for simulation runs
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-19] — Add Allied Health phase-2 workflow automation and Program Owner resource authoring

### What changed
- Added a new automated Allied Health workflow test script covering:
  - day-folder discovery from test content
  - day resource creation (`content`, `lesson_plan`, `roleplay`)
  - day quiz creation
  - quiz CSV-to-question import and quiz slot attachment
  - cohort-sync learner enrollment validation
  - trainer release and learner visibility checks
- Updated baseline Program Owner capabilities to include resource activity creation.
- Removed admin fallback from automated test path so content creation is validated under Program Owner permissions.

### Why
Program Owners need to independently create and manage course content and quizzes for Allied Health workflows. The new automation validates this flow end-to-end using mock roles and catches role-capability gaps early.

### Files touched
- `scripts/test/test_allied_health_quiz_workflow.php` — New/expanded phase-2 workflow automation for Allied Health quiz-first flow
- `scripts/config/configure_workflow_simulation_baseline.php` — Added `mod/resource:addinstance` for `sceh_program_owner`
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-19] — Switch to manual trainer unlock model for Allied Health workflow

### What changed
- Changed Allied Health workflow from automatic attendance-based unlock to manual trainer control
- All quizzes, assignments, and assessments now start hidden and Trainer shows them via eye icon
- Removed Restrict Access conditions from module activities (quizzes, assignments, OJT assessments, Final Assessment)
- Trainer marks attendance AND manually shows/hides activities based on attendance status and session readiness
- Updated workflow documentation throughout: setup steps, trainer workflow, learner journey, access logic table, troubleshooting, and checklist

### Why
Attendance timing is variable (may be recorded during session, after session, or elsewhere). Manual unlock gives Trainer control over when content becomes available regardless of when attendance is recorded, avoiding unintended unlocks for absent/late/excused learners and supporting flexible attendance workflows.

### Files touched
- `docs/ALLIED_HEALTH_FOUNDATIONAL_COURSE_WORKFLOW.md` — Updated Steps 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, Trainer workflow section, Learner journey section, Access/unlock logic table, troubleshooting section, and first-time setup checklist to reflect manual unlock model

---

## [2026-02-19] — Grant trainer visibility control permissions

### What changed
- Granted `sceh_trainer` role minimum capabilities to show/hide Module Content folders and activities
- Added capabilities:
  - `moodle/course:activityvisibility` - Show/hide activities using eye icon
  - `moodle/course:manageactivities` - Required for visibility toggle to work
- Trainers can now release Module Content folders during sessions without Program Owner involvement
- Trainers still CANNOT add, delete, or edit activities - only control visibility

### Why
Allied Health workflow requires trainers to release Module Content folders at appropriate times (before, during, or after sessions). Without these capabilities, trainers couldn't use the eye icon, blocking the documented workflow. This grants minimum permissions needed for content release while maintaining course structure control with Program Owner.

### Files touched
- `scripts/config/configure_trainer_visibility_permissions.php` — New idempotent script to grant trainer visibility capabilities
- `docs/ALLIED_HEALTH_FOUNDATIONAL_COURSE_WORKFLOW.md` — Updated permission check note to reflect correct capabilities
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-18] — Simplify Program Owner course navigation for multi-category ownership

### What changed
- Removed `Manage Programs` from Program Owner quick actions to align with current governance model.
- Updated `Manage Courses` sub-actions to support multi-category Program Owners:
  - `All Courses`
  - `Create in <Category>`
  - `Manage in <Category>`
- Kept course operations under `Manage Courses` (`Bulk Import`, `Validate Courses`, `Publish Courses`).
- Logged a dedicated dashboard click-through mapping run (`WF-14`) with route/capability findings in the golden suite.

### Why
Program/category administration remains a Sysadmin responsibility. This update removes misleading category-management paths from Program Owner UX and improves clarity for owners assigned to multiple categories (for example, AOP + Optometry).

### Files touched
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Removed Manage Programs action and added multi-category Manage Courses links
- `block_sceh_dashboard/lang/en/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Added category-aware Manage Courses labels
- `docs/WORKFLOW_SIMULATION_GOLDEN_TEST_SUITE.md` — Added WF-14 click-through mapping results and blockers
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-18] — Refine Program Owner Status and Monitoring interaction

### What changed
- Reworked Program Owner `Status and Monitoring` to match the quick-action interaction pattern:
  - top-level clickable summary cards
  - single expandable detail panel below
- Renamed `Publishing` to `Courses/Programs` in status cards.
- Simplified detail entries to compact KPI format (count + label only), removing long description text.
- Improved detail-row spacing/alignment between count badge and title for better readability.

### Why
This makes status review faster and more consistent with the dashboard’s primary interaction model while reducing visual clutter in operational monitoring views.

### Files touched
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Added status summary/panel rendering and compact status detail content
- `block_sceh_dashboard/lang/en/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Updated status card naming (`Courses/Programs`)
- `block_sceh_dashboard/styles.css` — Added status panel/card styling and spacing/alignment fixes
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-18] — Improve Program Owner dashboard actions and accessibility styling

### What changed
- Updated Program Owner dashboard quick actions to support expandable sub-action panels for grouped workflows:
  - `Manage Programs`
  - `Manage Courses`
  - `Manage Competencies`
- Added competency sub-actions:
  - `Add Framework`
  - `View Frameworks`
- Improved Program Owner role detection in theme body classes for category-scoped Program Owners.
- Updated Program Owner dashboard styles for better usability and accessibility:
  - removed gradient styling in Program Owner action/sub-action cards
  - enforced high-contrast text/background combinations
  - fixed sub-action card label wrapping by using content-width buttons

### Why
Program Owners needed clearer, task-oriented navigation without unreadable inline links, and visual treatment needed to meet accessibility expectations for contrast and readability.

### Files touched
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Added expandable sub-action behavior and competency sub-actions
- `block_sceh_dashboard/lang/en/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Added new Program Owner action strings
- `block_sceh_dashboard/styles.css` — Implemented accessible flat color styles and sub-action sizing/wrapping fixes
- `theme_sceh/classes/output/core_renderer.php` — Added category-scoped Program Owner detection fallback for body class routing
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-18] — Add WF-12 reporting schedule bootstrap and close WF-12/WF-13 workflow blockers

### What changed
- Added idempotent WF-12 scheduling bootstrap script:
  - `scripts/config/configure_workflow_reporting_schedule.php`
  - supports `verify` and `apply` modes
  - supports explicit recipient usernames and optional `--run-now` execution check
  - auto-creates a dedicated custom report when selected report cannot be scheduled reliably (no custom columns)
- Updated workflow execution log with re-runs:
  - `WF-12` moved to pass after schedule creation and task execution validation
  - `WF-13` moved to pass after direct access-path validation for Trainer Coach dashboard

### Why
WF-12 previously depended on manual report scheduling and had no reliable bootstrap path across environments. This script provides a repeatable setup for dev/staging/prod and verifies routing behavior. WF-13 was blocked by a capability-snapshot interpretation; direct access-path validation confirms Trainer Coach flow works as intended.

### Files touched
- `scripts/config/configure_workflow_reporting_schedule.php` — New WF-12 schedule bootstrap and validation script
- `scripts/README.md` — Added command examples for WF-12 schedule setup
- `docs/WORKFLOW_SIMULATION_GOLDEN_TEST_SUITE.md` — Added WF-12 and WF-13 re-run pass logs
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-18] — Continue workflow simulation through WF-13 and fix Program Owner queue routing

### What changed
- Executed and logged workflow simulations from `WF-06` through `WF-13` in the golden suite with pass/fail/blocked outcomes and command-level evidence.
- Fixed dashboard workflow queue role routing so category-scoped Program Owners are detected as Program Owners (not incorrectly routed to learner queue).
- Captured newly discovered gaps during simulation:
  - `WF-10` mobile/cross-device learner-path validation still pending
  - `WF-12` scheduled reporting cannot be validated because no report schedules are configured
  - `WF-13` Trainer Coach card is visible but linked capability is not granted

### Why
This keeps the workflow validation program moving with reproducible evidence while fixing a real role-routing defect that would misclassify Program Owner operational work. It also leaves a clear defect trail for remaining environment/config gaps before staging/production validation.

### Files touched
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Added Program Owner category-assignment fallback in workflow queue role detection
- `docs/WORKFLOW_SIMULATION_GOLDEN_TEST_SUITE.md` — Logged WF-06 through WF-13 runs, outcomes, and blockers
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-18] — Automate Program Owner competency role dependency

### What changed
- Added automatic role dependency handling in `local_sceh_rules`:
  - assigning `sceh_program_owner` auto-assigns `sceh_program_owner_competency` at system context
  - unassigning `sceh_program_owner` removes managed competency role only when no Program Owner assignments remain
- Added observer registration for:
  - `\core\event\role_assigned`
  - `\core\event\role_unassigned`
- Added backfill/sync script:
  - `scripts/config/sync_program_owner_competency_roles.php`
  - supports `--dry-run` for safe verification
- Extended baseline setup docs/scripts to support real-environment Program Owner assignment and dependency setup.

### Why
This removes manual two-role assignment overhead for Sysadmins while preserving least-privilege boundaries. Program Owners can manage competencies without broadening category governance permissions.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_rules/db/events.php` — Registered role assignment/unassignment observers
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/observer/program_owner_role_observer.php` — New dependency automation logic
- `scripts/config/sync_program_owner_competency_roles.php` — New backfill/sync utility
- `scripts/config/configure_workflow_simulation_baseline.php` — Real-environment role assignment support
- `docs/MOCK_USERS_SETUP.md` — Added real-environment assignment instructions
- `scripts/README.md` — Added sync script usage
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-18] — Add mode-safe workflow baseline setup for local and real environments

### What changed
- Added a new baseline script for workflow simulation setup:
  - `scripts/config/configure_workflow_simulation_baseline.php`
- Added explicit execution modes:
  - `local` (default): applies mock/test baseline for WF-01 to WF-04
  - `verify-real-env`: read-only checks for real environments
  - `apply-real-env`: applies only real-environment role/capability baseline
- Added `--dry-run` support and hard guardrails:
  - skips mock-user and mock-cohort mutations in real-environment modes
  - requires `--category-idnumber` for real-environment modes
- Updated setup documentation with mode-specific command examples.

### Why
This separates test-environment setup from real-environment validation, so teams can run mock workflows safely in development while using controlled, non-mock baseline checks/applies in staging or production.

### Files touched
- `scripts/config/configure_workflow_simulation_baseline.php` — New idempotent baseline setup script with mode guards
- `docs/MOCK_USERS_SETUP.md` — Added local/real-environment usage instructions
- `scripts/README.md` — Added script mode examples
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-18] — Add workflow simulation checklist and golden test suite logs

### What changed
- Added a workflow simulation sequence document to define execution order from `WF-01` to `WF-13`
- Added a reusable pass/fail checklist template for each workflow run
- Added a separate golden test suite log file for cross-tester sharing
- Logged executed runs for `WF-01` to `WF-04` with evidence, outcomes, and defect tracking
- Recorded and validated fixes for:
  - missing mock user `idnumber` values and explicit learner assignment
  - Program Owner over-permission at system context (category isolation defect)
  - Program Owner missing course/quiz review and quiz creation capabilities

### Why
This creates a single, shareable test baseline for workflow validation. It improves repeatability across testers, makes failures auditable, and allows incremental remediation while preserving run history.

### Files touched
- `docs/WORKFLOW_SIMULATION_CHECKLIST.md` — Workflow sequence and pass/fail criteria template
- `docs/WORKFLOW_SIMULATION_GOLDEN_TEST_SUITE.md` — Golden execution log with run evidence and defect outcomes
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-18] — Security and Reliability Improvements

### What changed
- Added MIME type validation to file uploads in addition to extension checking
- Standardized configuration path detection across all CLI scripts using centralized helper
- Added session timeout validation (30 minutes) to import preview workflow
- Improved temporary file cleanup with proper error handling and race condition prevention
- Enhanced error handling in badge configuration script with better debugging output
- Fixed CSRF vulnerability in rule deletion by using POST forms instead of GET links
- Added capability re-checks in workflow queue for defense-in-depth security
- Replaced magic numbers with named constants for better maintainability
- Added audit logging for package imports using Moodle event system
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files after successful import

### Why
These changes improve security by preventing file type spoofing attacks, CSRF attacks, and ensuring proper authorization checks. They increase reliability by handling edge cases in file operations and providing audit trails for compliance. The system is now more maintainable with centralized configuration logic and named constants.

### Files touched
- `scripts/lib/config_helper.php` — New centralized config path helper
- `scripts/config/configure_badge_system.php` — Uses new config helper, improved error handling
- `local_sceh_importer/update_file.php` — Added MIME type validation, named constants
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Added session timeout check, named constants
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/package_scanner.php` — Improved temp file handling with cleanup
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/import_executor.php` — Added audit event and temp cleanup
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/event/package_imported.php` — New audit event for imports
- `local_sceh_importer/lang/en/local_sceh_importer.php` — Added event language string
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/output/sceh_card.php` — Added POST form support for buttons
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/helper/rules_table_renderer.php` — Delete actions now use POST with CSRF protection
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Added capability re-checks in workflow queue

---

## [2026-02-18] — Add quiz preview in import workflow

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added "Preview Questions" button next to quiz activities in import preview
- Modal displays all questions with correct answers marked
- Shows question type, options, and correct answers for verification
- Supports multichoice, truefalse, shortanswer, and essay question types

### Why
Users can now verify quiz CSV parsed correctly before importing, catching formatting errors and content issues early.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Added preview button, modal, and JavaScript for quiz preview
- `local_sceh_importer/lang/en/local_sceh_importer.php` — Added preview strings

---

## [2026-02-18] — Fix critical bugs in individual file replacement

**Commit**: `a0a66d6` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Fixed data loss risk: new activity is created first, then old one is archived (not vice versa)
- Fixed section mapping: now reads correct section number from course_sections table
- Restricted individual replace to resource modules only (quiz/assign not supported)
- Implemented courseid preselection when navigating from update page to bulk import
- Removed duplicate docblock in import_executor.php

### Why
Critical fixes prevent data loss if creation fails, ensure activities are placed in correct sections, and prevent broken modules from being created. Courseid preselection improves UX when switching between individual and bulk update modes.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/update_file.php` — Create before archive, fix section mapping, restrict to resource modules
- `local_sceh_importer/update.php` — Only show replace button for resource modules
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Accept and pass courseid parameter to form
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/form/upload_form.php` — Use preselected courseid if provided
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/import_executor.php` — Removed duplicate docblock
- `local_sceh_importer/lang/en/local_sceh_importer.php` — Added error_unsupportedmoduletype string

---

## [2026-02-18] — Add YouTube and external link support via links.csv

**Commit**: `e23ee8f` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added links.csv support for YouTube videos and external URLs in any content folder
- CSV format: order, title, url, type, audience, notes
- YouTube videos are automatically embedded, other URLs open in new window
- Links sorted by order column with row number as tiebreaker
- No URL validation (format or reachability) - accepts any URL
- Type column is metadata only (not enforced)
- Added example links.csv to downloadable template
- Updated README with links.csv documentation

### Why
Users can now add YouTube videos and external resources without uploading files. Keeps links organized alongside related content in each folder.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/package_scanner.php` — Added parse_links_csv method, detect and process links.csv files
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/import_executor.php` — Added build_url_moduleinfo method, create URL activities
- `local_sceh_importer/templates/course-package-template/links.csv` — Example CSV with YouTube and external links
- `local_sceh_importer/templates/course-package-template/README.txt` — Added links.csv documentation
- `local_sceh_importer/templates/course-package-template.zip` — Updated template with links.csv

---

## [2026-02-18] — Fix critical security and validation issues

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added file type validation (PDF, Word, PowerPoint, media only) with 100MB size limit
- Added 30-minute session expiration for file replacement previews
- Added course-level permission check (moodle/course:update) in update page
- Fixed backward compatibility for validation errors (handles both array and string formats)
- Extracted template version to constant in version.php
- Added error messages for invalid file types and oversized files

### Why
Security hardening: prevent malicious file uploads, enforce proper permissions, prevent session hijacking. Backward compatibility ensures existing code doesn't break.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/update_file.php` — File type validation, size limit, session expiration
- `local_sceh_importer/update.php` — Course-level permission check
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Backward compatible error display, use version constant
- `local_sceh_importer/version.php` — Added template version constant
- `local_sceh_importer/lang/en/local_sceh_importer.php` — Added error strings
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

## [2026-02-18] — Add quiz template and auto-ignore metadata files

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added template_quiz.csv with all question types (multichoice, truefalse, shortanswer, essay)
- Scanner now ignores README.txt, .DS_Store, Thumbs.db, desktop.ini, template_quiz.csv
- Added template version (v1.0) to README and validation success message
- Updated README to reference template_quiz.csv instead of inline example

### Why
Users no longer need to delete README.txt or worry about OS metadata files. Template quiz reduces CSV format errors.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/templates/course-package-template/template_quiz.csv` — Example quiz with correct headers
- `local_sceh_importer/templates/course-package-template/README.txt` — Added version, removed delete instruction
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/package_scanner.php` — Auto-ignore metadata files
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Show template version after validation
- `local_sceh_importer/lang/en/local_sceh_importer.php` — Added template version string

- `local_sceh_importer/templates/course-package-template.zip` — Regenerated with updates
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

## [2026-02-18] — Add contextual validation errors with folder paths and inline structure help

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Validation errors now show folder paths and expected file types
- Added "Fix:" hints for common errors (missing files, quiz CSVs)
- Added collapsible "Show supported folder structures" section on upload form
- Structured error format includes location, expected file, and actionable fix

### Why
Users need to know exactly where the problem is and how to fix it. Generic errors like "File not found" are frustrating without context.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/manifest_builder.php` — Structured error format with folder paths
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Enhanced error display with hints, added structure preview
- `local_sceh_importer/lang/en/local_sceh_importer.php` — Added structure help strings
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-18] — Add downloadable folder template and hide debug details by default

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added downloadable ZIP template with empty folder structure (01. Week 1/01. Day 1/content/, quiz/, etc.)
- Added README.txt in template explaining folder structure, quiz CSV format, and file types
- Added download link on upload form with help text
- Manifest YAML now hidden by default (visible under "Show debug details")

### Why
Non-tech users need a clear starting point. Empty folders prevent accidental file uploads and the README explains exactly what goes where.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/templates/course-package-template/` — Empty folder structure with README
- `local_sceh_importer/templates/course-package-template.zip` — Downloadable template
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Added template download link
- `local_sceh_importer/lang/en/local_sceh_importer.php` — Added template strings
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

## [2026-02-18] — Add incremental update feature for targeted file replacement

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added new update page showing existing course structure with replace buttons per activity
- Added individual file replacement flow with preview and confirmation
- Added bulk update option that redirects to main import page with course pre-selected
- Made archive_existing_activity method public for reuse in file replacement
- Both bulk and individual updates use same versioning and archiving behavior

### Why
Program Owners need an easy way to update individual files without re-uploading entire course packages. The unified entry point handles both targeted and bulk updates.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/update.php` — New course update page with structure view
- `local_sceh_importer/update_file.php` — Individual file replacement with preview
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/form/file_upload_form.php` — File upload form
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/import_executor.php` — Made archive method public
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Added link to update page
- `local_sceh_importer/lang/en/local_sceh_importer.php` — Added update page strings
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

## [2026-02-18] — Improve importer UX with plain-language errors, bulk controls, and collapsible groups

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Rewrote 20+ error messages to use plain language instead of technical jargon
- Added bulk selection controls: "Select all new" and "Deselect all existing" buttons
- Added collapsible section/topic groups with expand/collapse all controls
- Added versioning help modal with explanation of V2/V3 behavior
- Added learner impact warnings showing quiz attempts and assignment submissions for existing activities
- Improved visual hierarchy with toggle icons for collapsible groups

### Why
Program owners need clear, actionable error messages and efficient ways to manage large imports. Learner impact visibility prevents accidental data loss.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/lang/en/local_sceh_importer.php` — Rewrote error messages, added new UI strings
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Added bulk controls, collapsible groups, versioning help modal, learner impact detection
- `local_sceh_importer/styles.css` — Added styles for collapsible groups and toggle icons
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-18] — Refine import completion metrics and remove expected archive notices from warnings

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Updated import completion summary semantics:
  - `Added` now reports imported selected activities (including replacements).
  - `Skipped` now reports uploaded activities not applied from the uploaded set.
  - `Replaced` remains explicit replacement count.
- Stopped treating successful archive-before-replace steps as execution warnings.
- Kept warning channel focused on actionable issues only.

### Why
The completion screen should reflect operator intent directly. Replacements are planned behavior and should not appear as warnings, while summary numbers must align with what was selected from the ZIP.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Adjusted completion summary math and display labels
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/import_executor.php` — Removed archive success messages from warning output
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-18] — Generalize replacement flow across activities and align import summary semantics

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Expanded replacement behavior from quiz-only to all existing selected activity types (resource, lesson plan, roleplay, assignment, quiz).
- Added a generic replacement confirmation modal before import when selected rows include existing activities.
- Added replacement archiving support in executor:
  - Existing activity is hidden before new version import.
  - Name is prefixed as archived where module table supports `name`.
- Fixed execution path to run the selected/modified preview manifest (instead of stale saved manifest).
- Added case-insensitive idnumber matching for existing-activity detection and replacement processing.
- Updated post-import success summary semantics:
  - `Added` = net new additions from uploaded set.
  - `Skipped` = uploaded activities not applied in this run.
  - `Replaced` = activities explicitly replaced.
- Excluded topic-marker bookkeeping from activity summary counts so metrics match user-selected rows.
- Added preview-time inline quiz row validation (question type/options/correct answer checks) to fail loudly before import.

### Why
Program owners need replacements to behave consistently across all content types, not just quizzes. Summary counts also need to reflect user intent from the uploaded package so import outcomes are immediately understandable.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Generalized replacement selection/confirmation flow, fixed manifest execution source, and updated summary metric calculation
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/import_executor.php` — Added generic activity archiving/replacement tracking and removed topic-marker impact from summary counts
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/manifest_builder.php` — Added inline quiz row validation in preview stage
- `local_sceh_importer/lang/en/local_sceh_importer.php` — Added replacement confirmation and summary label strings
- `local_sceh_importer/styles.css` — Added grouped-row and modal styling used by replacement confirmation UX
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-18] — Add activity-selection step before import with status-based defaults

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added a pre-import activity selection step after successful ZIP validation.
- Added activity status detection against the target course:
  - `New` activities are pre-selected.
  - `Existing` activities are unselected by default.
- Import now applies only selected activity idnumbers from the validation result.
- Added a guard error when no activities are selected for import.
- Added visual polish for selection table:
  - Compact checkbox alignment
  - Status badges
  - Existing rows dimmed for clearer replacement decisions

### Why
Program owners need a clear confirmation step before writing changes, especially when re-importing packages into partially populated courses. This reduces accidental overwrites and makes update intent explicit.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Added selection-table rendering, status detection, and selected-idnumber import filtering
- `local_sceh_importer/lang/en/local_sceh_importer.php` — Added selection/status/error strings
- `local_sceh_importer/styles.css` — Added selection-table visual styling for status and readability
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

## [2026-02-17] — Tighten importer naming checks and remove confusing program dropdown option

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added duplicate checks for `Create new program`:
  - Program ID number must be unique.
  - Program name must be unique.
- Added duplicate check for `Create new course`:
  - Course full name must be unique.
- Added required validation for program name when creating a new program.
- Removed `Create new program (enter below)` from the existing-program dropdown to avoid mixed intent in the same control.
- Added matching backend guards in controller logic so duplicate creation is blocked even if client-side validation is bypassed.

### Why
Users should get immediate, clear feedback when trying to create entities that already exist. Keeping the existing-program dropdown limited to real options also reduces confusion and aligns the UI with the selected create/use mode.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/form/upload_form.php` — Added uniqueness and required-field validation; removed pseudo-option from existing-program select
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Added server-side duplicate guards and passed existing names into form context
- `local_sceh_importer/lang/en/local_sceh_importer.php` — Added new user-facing validation strings
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

---

## [2026-02-17] — Simplify importer to validate-first workflow with conditional program/course setup

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Simplified importer form to conditional mode-based inputs:
  - `Use existing program` vs `Create new program`
  - `Use existing course` vs `Create new course`
- Reduced required manual inputs for new course creation to only course full name; shortname/idnumber/category are generated by system defaults.
- Removed standalone quiz spreadsheet upload path from importer UI; quiz CSV handling is now package-structure-first.
- Changed primary form action from draft preview language to `Validate ZIP file`.
- Added validation-first import gating:
  - Validation result shows clear pass/fail status.
  - Import button appears only when blocking errors are absent.
  - Import is disabled when validation errors exist.
- Moved technical manifest/tables into a collapsible `Show debug details` section.
- Removed non-blocking warning that implied `roleplay_assessment` requires `rubric_idnumber`; rubric linkage is now independent.
- Added UX specification for next step: visual file-tree selection, replace confirmation, and quiz preview.

### Why
The importer needed to be usable by non-technical operators without exposing internal manifest complexity by default. This change keeps the flow task-oriented and safe: select/create program and course, validate ZIP, and import only when ready.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/form/upload_form.php` — Added conditional existing/new program and course modes; reduced and scoped visible inputs
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Implemented validate-first and gated import flow with session-backed validated state
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/manifest_builder.php` — Removed rubric warning coupling from roleplay validation
- `local_sceh_importer/lang/en/local_sceh_importer.php` — Added/updated production-facing labels and validation/import messaging
- `docs/IMPORT_VALIDATION_SELECTION_UX_SPEC.md` — Added planned visual review-and-selection UX spec
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

## [2026-02-17] — Fix inline quiz import to attach usable questions and recompute grades

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Fixed inline quiz backfill in `upsert` mode so existing quiz activities with matching idnumber can receive questions when currently empty.
- Fixed a warnings-collection bug in the existing-quiz path so execution feedback is recorded consistently.
- Tightened generated GIFT output for inline MCQ rows to improve Moodle parser compatibility.
- Fixed question attach accounting logic to match Moodle 5.1 behavior (`quiz_add_quiz_question` does not return success boolean).
- Added quiz grade recomputation after question slot insert so `sumgrades` is updated and attempts are not blocked.
- Added repair path: when quiz already has slots but `sumgrades` is `0`, recompute is triggered during import run.

### Why
Imported quizzes were appearing with no attemptable grade state in some flows because questions were added but quiz totals were not recalculated. This change ensures inline-imported quizzes are both populated and immediately usable by learners.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/import_executor.php` — Fixed inline quiz backfill, GIFT generation, question attach logic, and sumgrades recomputation
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

## [2026-02-16] — Add package-importer intake MVP (zip + spreadsheet to validated manifest preview)

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added a new local plugin, `local_sceh_importer`, as the first runnable slice of the package-import workflow.
- Added an upload page for Program Manager/Program Owner roles to submit a package zip and optional quiz spreadsheet CSV.
- Implemented package scanning to auto-draft sections and activities from folder structure for:
  - resources (`assets/common`, `assets/streams/...`)
  - assignments (`assignments/`)
  - quizzes (`quizzes/*.xml`, `quizzes/*.gift`, optional inline rows from CSV)
  - trainer-only lesson plans (`lesson_plans/`)
  - trainer-only roleplay guidance/assets (`roleplay/`)
- Implemented validation and preview with explicit errors/warnings and generated manifest YAML output.
- Mounted the new importer plugin in both Moodle web and cron containers so it is available in the active MoodleHQ stack.

### Why
Before building full import execution, we need a safe intake and validation stage that non-technical content creators can use. This MVP verifies package structure early, surfaces issues clearly, and gives a deterministic manifest preview before any write operations happen.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_importer/version.php` — Plugin metadata/version for Moodle 5.1 stack
- `local_sceh_importer/db/access.php` — Added manage capability (`local/sceh_importer:manage`)
- `local_sceh_importer/lang/en/local_sceh_importer.php` — UI strings and validation error messages
- `local_sceh_importer/settings.php` — Added admin entry/link under local plugins
- `local_sceh_importer/index.php` — Upload + validate + preview controller page
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/form/upload_form.php` — Upload form for zip, optional quiz CSV, import mode, and dry-run
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/package_scanner.php` — Package extraction and folder-to-activity scan logic
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/quiz_sheet_parser.php` — Non-technical quiz CSV parser
- `local_sceh_importer/classes/local/manifest_builder.php` — Draft manifest build, validation, and YAML rendering
- `docker-compose.moodlehq.yml` — Mounted `local_sceh_importer` for web and cron services
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added this release entry

## [2026-02-14] — Define course package import blueprint and non-technical authoring path

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added a dedicated blueprint for folder + manifest course imports, covering intent, process, role ownership, schema structure, import modes, and phased rollout.
- Added non-technical quiz authoring guidance (spreadsheet/form intake with automatic conversion to import-ready quiz payloads).
- Added required quality-gate policy for package imports, including critical blockers and warning-level checks.
- Added required rollback strategy by import job with scoped rollback and safety constraints for learner data.
- Cross-linked the blueprint from user and system FAQs.

### Why
Course creators are often non-technical, while the platform still needs strict import governance. This blueprint aligns both needs by defining a creator-friendly intake flow with strong validation, auditability, and recovery controls before implementation starts.

### Files touched
- `docs/COURSE_PACKAGE_IMPORT_BLUEPRINT.md` — New implementation reference for package import architecture and policy
- `docs/USER_FAQ.md` — Added user-facing pointer and FAQ coverage for package import path
- `docs/SYSTEM_FAQ.md` — Added system-level pointer to blueprint and implementation context
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added release entry for this documentation update

---

## [2026-02-14] — Add user-facing FAQs and composite workflow guidance

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added a new user-focused FAQ covering practical "How do I..." tasks across Program Owner, System Admin, Trainer, Trainer Coach, and Learner roles.
- Added a system FAQ for architecture-level questions (competency mapping model, workflow queue data sources, stream behavior, and configuration boundaries).
- Expanded workflow documentation with composite end-to-end lifecycle flows and role handoff guidance.
- Linked workflow docs to the new FAQ references for faster onboarding and support handoffs.

### Why
As workflows became cross-role and more feature-rich, new users needed a clear operational reference that is easier to navigate than implementation notes. This improves onboarding speed, support consistency, and readiness for upcoming real-content trials.

### Files touched
- `docs/USER_FAQ.md` — New detailed role/task FAQ for everyday operations
- `docs/SYSTEM_FAQ.md` — New architecture/system-behavior FAQ
- `docs/USER_WORKFLOWS.md` — Added composite workflow guidance and FAQ cross-links
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added release entry for this documentation update

---

## [2026-02-14] — Introduce role-based workflow queue and dashboard layout improvements

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added a dynamic, role-aware **Workflow Queue** on dashboard with three buckets: `Do Now`, `This Week`, and `Watchlist`.
- Populated queue items from Moodle-native signals (events, tasks, cohorts, grading backlog, stream setup checks) with lightweight derived rules.
- Added role-specific timeline visibility: kept Timeline for learners and hid it for system admin, program owner, trainer, and trainer coach.
- Replaced dashboard calendar blocks with workflow-first layout in the SCEH theme.
- Improved dashboard readability with wider responsive content area for `/my/`.
- Polished workflow card alignment (left-aligned content, consistent icon placement, action button anchoring).
- Centralized dashboard/status color usage through theme tokens and token-backed card styles.
- Updated site naming defaults to `SCEH` for new stack installs and aligned current runtime name.
- Documented workflow-queue model and data-source strategy in the workflow reference.

### Why
The dashboard needed to prioritize operational next actions over generic calendar widgets. This change makes the role journey clearer, improves scanability on desktop/mobile, and establishes a maintainable design-token foundation for future UI updates.

### Files touched
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Added dynamic workflow queue generation and rendering logic
- `block_sceh_dashboard/lang/en/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Added workflow queue strings and labels
- `block_sceh_dashboard/styles.css` — Refined dashboard/workflow presentation and token-based gradient usage
- `theme_sceh/classes/output/core_renderer.php` — Added role body classes for role-based dashboard behavior
- `theme_sceh/scss/internal.scss` — Added timeline/calendar visibility rules and dashboard width/header polish
- `theme_sceh/scss/tokens.scss` — Added semantic status and gradient tokens
- `local_sceh_rules/styles/sceh_card_system.css` — Improved workflow card/item alignment and tokenized status colors
- `docs/USER_WORKFLOWS.md` — Added workflow queue model, role flows, and implementation scope
- `docker-compose.moodlehq.yml` — Updated default site naming to `SCEH`

---

## [2026-02-14] — Standardize AI collaboration and release-note writing conventions

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to a cleaner, consolidated rule set for AI-assisted development behavior.
- Updated `CONVENTIONS.md` to align project conventions with the agreed release-note style and collaboration expectations.
- Preserved the customer-facing release-note structure as the default format for future entries.

### Why
We needed one consistent operating contract for AI tools and one consistent documentation style for release communication. This reduces ambiguity during implementation and keeps change history easier for non-technical stakeholders to follow.

### Files touched
- `AGENTS.md` — Reorganized and simplified agent operating rules
- `CONVENTIONS.md` — Updated project conventions and release-note expectations

---

## [2026-02-14] — Deliver branded SCEH login page and simplify sign-in actions

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added a custom Moodle theme (`theme_sceh`) with a branded, responsive logged-out experience and a dedicated login layout.
- Set logged-out `/` to route users to the login screen and logged-in users to their dashboard for a cleaner default journey.
- Removed guest-access and cookies-action clutter from the login panel to keep sign-in focused on authenticated users.
- Updated the login heading copy to “Log in to SCEH LMS”.
- Added theme implementation notes and visual-library guidance docs for follow-on UI work.

### Why
The default Moodle login and home flow was noisy and did not reflect the product identity. This update creates a clearer first impression, reduces decision friction at sign-in, and establishes a maintainable base for future UI improvements.

### Files touched
- `theme_sceh/config.php` — Theme configuration, layouts, and navigation adjustments
- `theme_sceh/layout/login.php` — Custom login layout wiring
- `theme_sceh/templates/login.mustache` — Branded login page shell and content structure
- `theme_sceh/templates/core/loginform.mustache` — Theme override of Moodle login form to simplify actions and heading
- `theme_sceh/classes/output/core_renderer.php` — Logged-in/logged-out homepage redirect behavior
- `theme_sceh/scss/login.scss` — Responsive login styling and component-level polish
- `theme_sceh/scss/internal.scss` — Internal page visual adjustments
- `theme_sceh/scss/components.scss` — Shared theme component styling
- `theme_sceh/scss/tokens.scss` — Theme color/spacing/shadow tokens
- `theme_sceh/lib.php` — Theme SCSS assembly hook
- `theme_sceh/lang/en/theme_sceh.php` — Theme copy strings including login heading text
- `theme_sceh/version.php` — Theme plugin metadata
- `docker-compose.moodlehq.yml` — Theme mount for web/cron containers
- `docs/LOGIN_BRANDING_THEME.md` — Operational guide for branded login theme
- `docs/THEME_VISUAL_LIBRARY.md` — Visual system notes for consistent implementation

## [2026-02-14] — Add workflow guardrails and automated card/page regression tests

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added automated PHPUnit coverage for shared card rendering (`simple`, `metric`, `list`, `detail`) and rules page card output.
- Added dashboard card-link regression tests to prevent known broken routes (missing required URL params).
- Added Trainer Coach cohort helper and enabled Trainer Coach-specific access path:
  - Trainer users in the `trainer-coaches` cohort now get a Training Evaluation card.
  - Trainer Coach path can open Kirkpatrick dashboard without granting broad access to all trainers.
- Hardened trainer attendance fallback link to a safe route (`My courses`) when no assigned cohort course is available.
- Fixed rules renderer string usage to plugin-local strings to avoid debugging notices in tests/runtime.
- Updated workflow status notes to reflect implemented Trainer Coach support and reporting setup expectations.

### Why
We had repeated UI regressions caused by invalid links and role-path drift. This update adds a reliable automated safety net for card/page behavior and closes the main remaining code-backed workflow gap (optional Trainer Coach flow) while keeping access scoped and explicit.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_rules/tests/sceh_card_test.php` — New renderer unit tests for card templates
- `local_sceh_rules/tests/rules_table_renderer_test.php` — New rules page card output tests
- `block_sceh_dashboard/tests/card_links_test.php` — New dashboard link regression tests and Trainer Coach card test
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/helper/trainer_coach_helper.php` — New cohort-based Trainer Coach detection helper
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Safe trainer attendance fallback and Trainer Coach evaluation card injection
- `local_kirkpatrick_dashboard/index.php` — Trainer Coach cohort access path for evaluation dashboard
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/helper/rules_table_renderer.php` — Replaced invalid core string keys with plugin-local strings
- `local_sceh_rules/lang/en/local_sceh_rules.php` — Added `disabled` and rule-deletion confirmation strings
- `docs/USER_WORKFLOWS.md` — Updated status markers for Trainer Coach and reporting dependencies

## [2026-02-14] — Migrate stream and Kirkpatrick summary pages to shared card system

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Migrated **Stream Setup Check** from checklist table to card-based status tiles.
- Migrated **Stream Progress** from section tables to card-based section/activity views.
- Migrated **Kirkpatrick dashboard summary metrics** (Levels 1-4) to shared metric cards.
- Kept filters, chart placeholders, permissions, and export actions unchanged.

### Why
This completes the planned Phase 2 usage rollout so major program-owner, learner, and sysadmin evaluation surfaces all use the same card foundation. The result is a more consistent UI model and lower maintenance cost for future layout changes.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_rules/stream_setup_check.php` — Replaced checklist table rendering with shared detail cards
- `local_sceh_rules/stream_progress.php` — Replaced section tables with shared list/detail cards
- `local_kirkpatrick_dashboard/index.php` — Replaced metric tiles with shared metric cards

---

## [2026-02-13] — Implement Phase 1 card system and migrate rules pages

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Implemented shared Phase 1 card renderer (`simple`, `metric`, `list`, `detail`) in `local_sceh_rules`.
- Added reusable card-system stylesheet for consistent card layouts, status states, stats, lists, and actions.
- Migrated Attendance Rules and Roster Rules from table rendering to card-based rendering.
- Updated roster rules page to use shared rules renderer (matching attendance rules behavior).
- Wired dashboard card rendering to use shared `sceh_card::simple()` with fallback.

### Why
This creates one reusable card foundation for the platform and removes duplicated ad-hoc card/table rendering. It also aligns rules-management UI with the approved card-system direction while preserving existing actions and permissions.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/output/sceh_card.php` — New shared card renderer with helper methods and Phase 1 templates
- `local_sceh_rules/styles/sceh_card_system.css` — New shared card-system styles
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/helper/rules_table_renderer.php` — Replaced table output with card output for attendance/roster rules
- `local_sceh_rules/attendance_rules.php` — Added card-system stylesheet include
- `local_sceh_rules/roster_rules.php` — Switched to shared renderer and added stylesheet include
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Uses shared simple card renderer with fallback

---

## [2026-02-13] — Standardize development on MoodleHQ 5.1 and scrub legacy stack paths

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Removed the legacy Bitnami compose stack from the repository entrypoint (`docker-compose.yml`).
- Updated environment template and env-generation script to MoodleHQ-only variables.
- Updated core setup and script docs to use the active MoodleHQ container names, paths, and URL (`127.0.0.1:8081`).
- Kept runtime validation on the new stack after cleanup (restart + version + mock-user checks).

### Why
Having two parallel stack definitions was causing confusion about which environment is authoritative. This cleanup makes MoodleHQ 5.1 the single development baseline and removes legacy setup paths from the active workflow.

### Files touched
- `docker-compose.yml` — Removed legacy stack definition
- `.env.example` — Removed legacy env keys, kept MoodleHQ-only configuration
- `scripts/generate-env.sh` — Generates only MoodleHQ-related credentials/settings
- `README.md` — Updated setup/run/test commands to MoodleHQ stack only
- `scripts/README.md` — Updated script execution examples to new container/path

## [2026-02-13] — Store attendance plugin as normal repository files

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Replaced an accidental gitlink/submodule-style entry for `mod/attendance` with regular tracked files.
- Ensured the attendance plugin is fully contained in this repository for local setup and future deployment.

### Why
The first attendance parity commit referenced the plugin as an embedded repository pointer, which can break fresh clones. This correction makes setup reproducible without extra submodule steps.

### Files touched
- `mod/attendance` — Added full plugin file tree as regular tracked files

---

## [2026-02-13] — Fix Attendance Reports parity on MoodleHQ stack

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added the Attendance activity plugin to the new MoodleHQ stack so existing attendance URLs resolve.
- Updated Sysadmin dashboard Attendance Reports card routing to open an enrolled course first.
- Kept a safe fallback to `My courses` when no enrolled course is available.

### Why
After migration, Attendance Reports card navigation showed missing-file and enrollment issues on the new stack. This change restores behavior parity with the earlier environment and keeps card navigation usable for mock role testing.

### Files touched
- `mod/attendance` — Added attendance module used by existing dashboard links
- `docker-compose.moodlehq.yml` — Mounted attendance module into Moodle web and cron containers
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Updated sysadmin attendance link selection to use enrolled courses

---

## [2026-02-13] — Add maintained MoodleHQ dev stack (Moodle 5.1 + MySQL 8)

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added a new Docker stack based on MoodleHQ images for ongoing development on Moodle 5.1.
- Added startup scripts to bootstrap core, run install/upgrade safely, and run cron separately.
- Added setup documentation for the new stack and updated repository docs/examples to use it.
- Added `.gitignore` protection for local Moodle core checkout to avoid accidental commits.
- Kept the previous stack available so development can continue while migration is validated.

### Why
The previous image path was not ideal for long-term updates. Moving to a maintained Moodle distribution now reduces upgrade risk later and keeps the project aligned with current Moodle releases while development is still in mock-data phase.

This also keeps the path to Azure cleaner: the new setup is closer to a standard production-style split (web + DB + cron), which is easier to carry forward when infrastructure is moved.

### Files touched
- `docker-compose.moodlehq.yml` — New MoodleHQ-based development stack
- `scripts/moodlehq/bootstrap-core.sh` — Core bootstrap script for Moodle source checkout
- `scripts/moodlehq/start-web.sh` — Web container startup/install/upgrade flow
- `scripts/moodlehq/start-cron.sh` — Dedicated cron container startup
- `scripts/moodlehq/entrypoint.d/00-noop.sh` — Entrypoint placeholder hook
- `docs/MOODLEHQ_MYSQL_DEV_STACK.md` — Setup and usage guide for the new stack
- `.env.example` — Added MoodleHQ environment variables and defaults
- `scripts/generate-env.sh` — Added secure variable generation for MoodleHQ stack
- `README.md` — Updated local run guidance for the new stack
- `.gitignore` — Ignore local `moodle-core/` checkout
- `docker-compose.yml` — Updated to align with current local development setup

## [2026-02-13] — Align card system docs to one practical Phase 1 path

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Updated the card system specification and pragmatic guide so both describe the same Phase 1 implementation.
- Standardized Phase 1 as one renderer class (`sceh_card`) with internal helper methods.
- Marked advanced card types (chart and activity) as intentionally deferred, not part of Phase 1.
- Updated badge styling guidance to match Moodle 5 / Bootstrap 5 examples.

### Why
The two documents had conflicting implementation guidance, which could lead to rework and inconsistent builds. This update gives one clear path for delivery and keeps implementation scope focused on what is needed now.

### Files touched
- `docs/CARD_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md` — Aligned architecture, scope, and phased plan
- `docs/CARD_SYSTEM_PRAGMATIC_IMPLEMENTATION.md` — Updated practical guidance and Moodle 5 badge examples

---

## [2026-02-13] — Add stage 4 program-owner stream setup checklist

**Commit**: `825e3cb` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added a new Program Owner page: `Stream Setup Check`.
- The page validates stream readiness for a selected course with pass/fail checks:
  - named Common Foundation section exists
  - at least one stream section exists (`STREAM - ...`)
  - stream Choice activity exists with options
- Added a Program Owner dashboard card to open this checklist directly.
- Added labels/messages for checklist items, status, and details.

### Why
Stage 4 helps Program Owners verify stream configuration before delivery starts. A read-only checklist gives quick visibility into setup quality without making automatic changes to course structure.

We reused `stream_helper` for shared section checks so setup validation stays consistent with trainer and learner stream behavior.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_rules/stream_setup_check.php` — New read-only stream setup checklist page
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/helper/stream_helper.php` — Added common-foundation presence check helper
- `local_sceh_rules/lang/en/local_sceh_rules.php` — Added checklist labels and status strings
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Added Program Owner `Stream Setup Check` card
- `block_sceh_dashboard/lang/en/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Added `streamsetupcheck` card label

---

## [2026-02-13] — Add stage 3 stream-filtered learner progress view

**Commit**: `fa1ba09` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added a new learner page: `Stream Progress`.
- The page now shows progress only for:
  - Common Foundation sections
  - the learner’s selected stream section
- Updated the learner `My Progress` card to open this new stream-filtered progress page.
- Added user-facing labels/messages for stream progress status and empty-state handling.
- Fixed section-title rendering so progress page does not depend on course format plugin lookup.

### Why
Stage 3 focuses on keeping learner progress relevant. Learners should see only shared foundation work plus their chosen specialization, not unrelated stream sections.

We reused `stream_helper` to centralize section-selection logic, so trainer and learner stream behavior stays consistent across dashboard and progress pages.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_rules/stream_progress.php` — New stream-filtered learner progress page
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/helper/stream_helper.php` — Added common/relevant section resolution helpers
- `local_sceh_rules/lang/en/local_sceh_rules.php` — Added stream progress labels and status strings
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Routed learner `My Progress` card to stream progress page

---

## [2026-02-13] — Standardize release notes writing style and policy source

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added a dedicated documentation-style standard in `CONVENTIONS.md` for release notes and commit messages.
- Defined release notes as customer-facing, plain-language, and outcome-first.
- Defined commit messages as technical and implementation-focused.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to enforce that release notes follow `CONVENTIONS.md`.
- Clarified that helper/utility additions should be explained in non-jargon terms in release notes.

### Why
Recent release-note entries needed a more consistent tone for non-technical stakeholders. Centralizing style rules in one source (`CONVENTIONS.md`) and making `AGENTS.md` enforce it ensures future notes stay readable while commit history remains technically precise.

### Files touched
- `CONVENTIONS.md` — Added release-notes and commit-message style standards
- `AGENTS.md` — Added enforcement note that release notes must follow `CONVENTIONS.md`
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Updated entries to match new plain-language format

---

## [2026-02-13] — Add stage 2 learner stream indicator from choice

**Commit**: `748f10a` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Learners now see a new dashboard card: **“Your Stream: …”** once they choose a specialization.
- Clicking that card takes the learner straight to the right section of their course.
- We added backend logic to:
  - read the learner’s stream choice,
  - find the matching course section,
  - build the correct link automatically.
- We added one new text label (`yourstream`) for this card.
- We also created mock test data so this could be verified end-to-end (`MOCK-AAP-2026`, `mock.learner`).

### Why
This makes the learner experience clearer: after choosing a stream, they can immediately see which stream they are in and go directly to it.

To keep this reliable, stream-matching logic is centralized in one shared helper (`stream_helper`) instead of being duplicated in different places. That makes behavior consistent and easier to maintain.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/helper/stream_helper.php` — Stream lookup and section mapping logic
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Learner “Your Stream” card
- `block_sceh_dashboard/lang/en/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Card label text (`yourstream`)

---

## [2026-02-13] — Add stage 1 stream support in trainer dashboard

**Commit**: `7210b9f` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Trainers now see stream information directly on their dashboard for assigned courses.
- Each course card shows how many streams are configured.
- Trainers also get direct cards for each stream (for example: `Stream: Front Desk Management`).
- Clicking a stream card opens that exact stream section in the course.
- We added small text labels for stream card titles and stream counts.

### Why
This helps trainers navigate faster. They can go directly to the stream they are teaching instead of opening the full course and searching manually.

To keep behavior consistent, stream detection is handled in one shared helper (`stream_helper`) rather than repeated in multiple dashboard methods.

### Files touched
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/helper/stream_helper.php` — Detects stream sections and normalizes stream names
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Adds trainer stream cards and stream counts
- `block_sceh_dashboard/lang/en/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Adds stream-related card labels

---

## [2026-02-13] — Card System Specification

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Created comprehensive card system specification using atomic design principles
- Defined 3-layer component architecture: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms
- Specified 4 card sizes: small, medium, large, full-width (all responsive)
- Defined 6 card templates: simple, metric, list, detail, chart, activity
- Documented implementation roadmap and complexity analysis
- Added usage examples for rules pages, trainer dashboard, system admin dashboard

### Why
Consistent card-based UI across all pages improves usability and creates cohesive visual language. Atomic design approach makes system easy to build, test, and extend. Status-driven color coding (green/yellow/red) provides at-a-glance insights. Responsive grid ensures mobile compatibility.

### Files touched
- `docs/CARD_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md` — Complete card system specification with atomic components, templates, and implementation guide

---

## [2026-02-13] — Fix dashboard runtime errors and add badge count UX

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Fixed multiple dashboard links that were failing due to missing required URL parameters.
- Updated System Admin cards so users only see cards they can actually access.
- Corrected competency capability checks to use valid Moodle capability names.
- Fixed a Kirkpatrick dashboard query that was causing runtime exceptions.
- Updated SCEH rules pages to use direct login + capability checks instead of fragile admin-section setup.
- Added a badge count in the Badge Management card title so admins can quickly see badge setup status.
- Added runbook notes for re-syncing mock sysadmin capabilities in local setup.

### Why
During role-based testing, users were hitting avoidable runtime errors (missing params, invalid capabilities, section setup failures). These changes make dashboard navigation safer and more predictable.

The badge count improves clarity for new environments by showing whether badges are configured yet.

### Files touched
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Safer card routing, capability checks, badge count
- `local_kirkpatrick_dashboard/index.php` — Program filter DB query fix (`get_records_select_menu`)
- `local_sceh_rules/roster_rules.php` — Replaced fragile admin setup flow
- `local_sceh_rules/edit_roster_rule.php` — Replaced fragile admin setup flow
- `local_sceh_rules/attendance_rules.php` — Replaced fragile admin setup flow
- `local_sceh_rules/edit_attendance_rule.php` — Replaced fragile admin setup flow
- `docs/MOCK_USERS_SETUP.md` — Added sysadmin capability re-sync instructions

---

## [2026-02-13] — Fix competency framework dashboard link context

**Commit**: `PENDING` on branch `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Updated the dashboard `Competency Framework` card links to include `pagecontextid` for:
- System Admin view in `get_system_admin_cards()`
- Program Owner view in `get_program_owner_cards()`

### Why
Moodle competency framework page requires `pagecontextid` in this flow. Without it, users hit a `missingparam` error from `required_param('pagecontextid')`.

### Files touched
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Added system context parameter to competency framework URLs

---

## [v1.3.0] — Week 1-2 Implementation: Role Separation & RBAC Foundation

**Date**: 2026-02-13  
**Branch**: `front-end-explorations`  
**Tag**: `v1.3.0-rbac-foundation`

### What changed
- Introduced three custom role paths for the dashboard:
  - System Admin
  - Program Owner
  - Trainer
- Added SCEH-specific capabilities to support explicit role detection and controlled access.
- Updated dashboard behavior so each role sees relevant cards and actions.
- Added category-based ownership support for Program Owners.
- Added cohort-based course filtering for Trainers.
- Created mock users and mock course/cohort data for repeatable local validation.

### Why

The goal was to separate responsibilities clearly:
1. **System Admin**: platform and user governance
2. **Program Owner**: program/course design ownership
3. **Trainer**: delivery for assigned cohorts

This reduces role overlap, prevents accidental over-permissioning, and aligns the product with the operating model in the implementation guide.

### Files touched
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Role-specific card routing and rendering
- `local_sceh_rules/db/access.php` — Added SCEH capability definitions
- `local_sceh_rules/lang/en/local_sceh_rules.php` — Added capability labels
- `local_sceh_rules/version.php` — Plugin version bump for capability updates
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/helper/cohort_filter.php` — Trainer cohort-to-course filtering
- `docs/MOCK_USERS_SETUP.md` — Mock user setup and verification runbook

### Testing completed
- ✅ All 6 capabilities registered in database
- ✅ All 3 custom roles created with correct capability matrix
- ✅ Dashboard role detection uses custom capabilities
- ✅ Cohort filter returns correct courses for mock.trainer
- ✅ Code synced to Docker container and caches purged
- ✅ Mock data created and verified

### Next steps
- Week 3-4: Stream Support via Sections
- Week 5: Dashboard Polish (terminology, mobile-responsive, attendance alerts)
- Week 6 (Optional): Trainer Coach capability

## [v1.2.0] — UX Simplification & Operations Documentation

**Date**: 2026-02-13  
**Branch**: `front-end-explorations`  
**Tag**: `v1.2.0-ux-operations-docs`

### What changed
- Created comprehensive UX simplification documentation
- Added pragmatic implementation guide (5-week plan)
- Added complete user workflows for all roles
- Added operations guide (backup, reporting, grading, audit, scaling)
- Added PRD with role architecture and 3-layer responsibility model
- Added 40 user stories with acceptance criteria
- Added attendance alerts to Week 5 implementation

### Why
Established complete documentation foundation for pragmatic UX simplification approach. Documents the 5-week implementation plan using Moodle's existing features rather than building custom systems. Provides step-by-step workflows, operations procedures, and clear role definitions.

### Files touched
- `docs/PRAGMATIC_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` — Complete 5-week implementation plan
- `docs/USER_WORKFLOWS.md` — Workflows for all roles
- `docs/OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md` — Backup, reporting, grading, audit, scaling
- `docs/PRD - Role, architecture and more.md` — Role architecture and responsibility layers
- `docs/User stories and acceptance criteria.md` — 40 user stories
- `.kiro/specs/ux-simplification/requirements.md` — Requirements specification

## [2026-02-13] — Attendance Alerts Documentation for Trainer Dashboard

**Commit**: `df49823`  
**Branch**: `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Documented attendance alerts card design for trainer dashboard (Week 5 scope)
- Defined proactive monitoring for learners below 75% attendance threshold
- Mapped approach to existing `local_sceh_rules/classes/rules/attendance_rule.php` infrastructure
- Added trainer workflow for reviewing attendance alerts
- Updated Week 5 time estimate from 2 days to 2.5 days
- Marked attendance rules as resolved in dependencies section

### Why
Trainers need proactive visibility into attendance issues before they become critical. The existing attendance infrastructure tracks data and blocks competency access reactively, but trainers had no documented dashboard pattern for intervention. This update captures the intended dashboard behavior and workflow so implementation can be completed consistently against a clear spec.

### Files touched
- `docs/PRAGMATIC_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` — Added attendance alerts design and implementation guidance to Week 5
- `docs/USER_WORKFLOWS.md` — Added "TRAINER: Review Attendance Alerts" workflow and marked dependency as resolved

---

## [2026-02-13] — PRD and User Stories Documentation

**Commit**: `5e95c4e`  
**Branch**: `front-end-explorations`  
**Tag**: `v1.2.0-ux-operations-docs`

### What changed
- Added Product Requirements Document (PRD) covering role architecture, streams, and learning paths
- Added 40 user stories with acceptance criteria across all roles
- Documented 3-layer responsibility model: Learning Design Authority, Delivery & Enablement, Oversight & Insight
- Defined 5 core roles with clear responsibilities and ownership mapping
- Explained structural distinctions: Cohort, Focus Stream, Learning Path
- Provided concrete examples across different program types (instructor-led, self-paced, hybrid)
- Included use cases for middle management programs, policy rollouts, and domain-specific upskilling

### Why
The PRD establishes the foundational architecture for the entire system. The 3-layer responsibility model prevents role confusion (trainer ≠ curriculum designer) and enables scale without quality loss. The user stories translate conceptual models into testable behaviors, providing a basis for detailed requirements, estimation, and implementation. This documentation ensures all stakeholders understand what each role can do and why the system is structured this way.

### Files touched
- `docs/PRD - Role, architecture and more.md` — Complete role architecture, responsibility layers, and structural distinctions
- `docs/User stories and acceptance criteria.md` — 40 user stories covering all roles with acceptance criteria

---

## [2026-02-13] — Operations Guide: Backup, Reporting, Grading & Audit

**Branch**: `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Created comprehensive operations guide covering backup/disaster recovery, reporting/analytics, assessment/grading, audit logs, and scaling
- Documented automated backup strategy (daily, weekly, monthly) with scripts and retention policies
- Defined 6 essential reports: cohort performance, trainer effectiveness, program health, learner progress, competency achievement, attendance
- Explained 3 grading scales (percentage, competency, pass/fail), rubric creation, and peer assessment workflow
- Documented audit log access, important events, compliance reporting, and retention policies
- Provided scaling guidance for 2000 users including performance optimization and capacity planning

### Why
Operational procedures are critical for system reliability and compliance. The guide addresses: (1) Backup & DR to prevent data loss with automated daily/weekly/monthly backups and recovery procedures, (2) Reporting to monitor program health and trainer effectiveness with 6 automated reports, (3) Grading to ensure consistent assessment with rubrics and peer review, (4) Audit logs for compliance and security monitoring with 180-day retention, (5) Scaling for 2000 users with caching, database optimization, and external video hosting.

### Files touched
- `docs/OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md` — Complete operational procedures for backup, reporting, grading, audit, and scaling (2000 users)

---

## [2026-02-13] — Category-Based Program Ownership

**Branch**: `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added Week 1.5 to pragmatic implementation guide: Category-Based Program Ownership
- Documented how Program Owners can create programs autonomously in assigned categories
- Added System Admin workflows for creating categories and assigning Program Owners
- Added Program Owner workflows for creating programs in their category
- Included dashboard code for showing only assigned categories
- Explained benefits: Program Owners are autonomous, System Admin not a bottleneck

### Why
Without category-based permissions, System Admin must create every program, becoming a bottleneck. With categories, Program Owners can create programs in their assigned category (e.g., "Allied Health Programs") while remaining unable to see other categories (e.g., "Surgical Fellowships"). This enables autonomous program creation while maintaining clear separation between program areas. Critical for scalability.

### Files touched
- `docs/PRAGMATIC_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` — Added Week 1.5 with category setup and dashboard code
- `docs/USER_WORKFLOWS.md` — Added System Admin category workflows and Program Owner category-aware workflows

---

## [2026-02-13] — Program Structure with Weekly Organization

**Branch**: `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added comprehensive documentation for program structure with streams and weekly organization
- Illustrated Allied Assist Program as complete example with 3 streams
- Documented use of Labels for weekly organization within sections
- Explained competency mapping per stream with concrete examples
- Clarified when to use streams vs separate programs

### Why
Users needed clarity on how to structure programs with specializations (streams) and how to organize content by weeks. The Label-based approach (Option B) provides flexibility to move content between weeks without affecting other sections, while maintaining clear visual progression for learners. The Allied Assist Program example demonstrates the complete hierarchy: Program → Streams → Weeks → Activities → Competencies.

### Files touched
- `docs/PRAGMATIC_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` — Enhanced Weeks 3-4 section with complete structure examples and weekly organization
- `docs/USER_WORKFLOWS.md` — Added detailed structure workflow and complete Allied Assist Program example

---

## [2026-02-13] — Trainer Coach Capability Documentation

**Branch**: `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Added optional Trainer Coach capability to pragmatic implementation guide (Week 6)
- Updated user workflows with Trainer Coach setup and operational procedures
- Documented cohort-based approach (no new role needed)
- Added trainer performance monitoring views and metrics
- Included Trainer Training Program (meta-course) concept

### Why
Trainer quality oversight is critical for program success. Rather than creating a 4th role, we enhance the existing Trainer role with an optional coaching capability. Trainers in the "Trainer Coaches" cohort see additional dashboard sections showing all trainers' performance metrics, enabling them to identify struggling trainers and provide targeted coaching. This approach is simpler than a separate role and allows coaches to also deliver training.

### Files touched
- `docs/PRAGMATIC_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` — Added Week 6 (optional) with Trainer Coach implementation
- `docs/USER_WORKFLOWS.md` — Added Trainer Coach workflows, setup procedures, and monitoring capabilities

---

## [2026-02-13] — User Workflows Documentation

**Branch**: `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Created comprehensive user workflows documentation covering all four roles
- Documented detailed step-by-step procedures for common tasks
- Added missing pieces: badge system, trainer performance monitoring, automated reporting
- Included critical dependencies and workflow sequences
- Provided time estimates for each workflow

### Why
Users need a complete reference for understanding how to use the system. This document serves as both training material and operational reference, covering everything from initial setup to daily operations. It addresses the complete user journey including badge awarding (trainers), trainer performance monitoring (system admin), and automated reporting setup.

### Files touched
- `docs/USER_WORKFLOWS.md` — Complete workflows for System Admin, Program Owner, Trainer, and Learner roles with detailed steps

---

## [2026-02-13] — Pragmatic Implementation Guide

**Branch**: `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Created comprehensive implementation guide for pragmatic approach
- Documented 5-week plan with detailed tasks for each week
- Provided code examples for role separation, cohort filtering, stream support, and dashboard polish
- Explained Moodle core concepts for developers new to Moodle
- Documented benefits, tradeoffs, and decision criteria

### Why
The pragmatic approach leverages Moodle's existing features (courses, sections, cohorts, roles) rather than building custom systems. This guide provides concrete implementation steps with code examples so developers can execute the 5-week plan. It explains what Moodle already provides and how to configure it correctly, making it accessible to developers unfamiliar with Moodle.

### Files touched
- `docs/PRAGMATIC_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` — Complete implementation guide with code examples, tradeoffs, and decision criteria

---

## [2026-02-13] — Pragmatic Approach Analysis

**Branch**: `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Created pragmatic analysis of requirements vs. Moodle capabilities
- Identified what Moodle already provides (competency framework, cohorts, roles, courses)
- Proposed 5-week pragmatic path vs. 24-week comprehensive rebuild
- Defined 4 phases: Role Separation (1w), Trainer Filtering (1w), Stream Support (2w), Dashboard Polish (1w)

### Why
The comprehensive requirements propose building custom entities (Programs, Streams, Content Assets) that largely duplicate existing Moodle features. This analysis applies RULE 1 (Simplest Solution First) to identify what we can achieve by configuring and extending Moodle rather than rebuilding it. The pragmatic approach delivers 80% of the value in 20% of the time by using courses as programs, sections as streams, and custom roles for RBAC.

### Files touched
- `.kiro/specs/ux-simplification/pragmatic-approach.md` — Complete analysis with tradeoffs and recommendation

---

## [2026-02-13] — UX Simplification & RBAC Requirements Complete

**Branch**: `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Completed comprehensive requirements document for UX simplification and RBAC enhancement
- Aligned requirements with PRD (Role, architecture and more.md) and 40 user stories
- Defined 5 custom roles: System Admin, Program Owner, Trainer, Trainer Coach, Learner
- Specified Program/Stream/Learning Path architecture separate from Moodle courses
- Defined Content Asset Library for reusable, versioned content
- Created 12-sprint roadmap (24 weeks / 6 months)
- Added traceability matrix mapping all 40 user stories to functional requirements

### Why
The current Moodle implementation has fundamental architectural misalignment with the required learning system. Generic LMS roles (Manager, Teacher, Student) don't support the 3-layer responsibility model (Learning Design Authority, Delivery & Enablement, Oversight & Insight). This requirements document provides a complete specification for rebuilding the system to support Programs with Focus Streams, role-based dashboards, and reusable content assets.

### Files touched
- `.kiro/specs/ux-simplification/requirements.md` — Completed all sections: roles, functional requirements, success metrics, timeline, traceability matrix

## [2026-02-13] — Security Hardening and Code Quality Improvements

**Branch**: `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Moved all Docker passwords to environment variables
- Added database transaction handling to multi-step operations
- Consolidated duplicate code in rules management pages
- Added null checks to dashboard SQL queries
- Organized 100+ root-level scripts into structured directories
- Created comprehensive security documentation
- Added session message size limits
- Enhanced error handling in rules engine

### Why
Security audit identified hardcoded credentials in docker-compose.yml and missing transaction protection in badge creation. Code quality review found significant duplication between attendance_rules.php and roster_rules.php, and missing null checks that could cause division by zero errors. File organization was needed to reduce root directory clutter from 100+ files to 10.

### Files touched
- `docker-compose.yml` — Replaced hardcoded passwords with environment variables, disabled debug mode by default
- `.env.example` — Created template for secure environment configuration
- `scripts/generate-env.sh` — Created automated secure password generation script
- `docs/DOCKER_SECURITY.md` — Added comprehensive security documentation
- `README.md` — Created project overview with security-first setup instructions
- `.gitignore` — Added .env files to ignore list
- `scripts/config/configure_badge_system.php` — Added transaction handling for badge creation
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/helper/transaction_helper.php` — Created reusable transaction helper class
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/helper/rules_table_renderer.php` — Created shared table rendering helper
- `local_sceh_rules/attendance_rules.php` — Refactored to use shared table renderer
- `local_sceh_rules/roster_rules.php` — Refactored to use shared table renderer, added proper escaping
- `local_kirkpatrick_dashboard/index.php` — Added null checks to all SQL queries
- `block_sceh_dashboard/block_sceh_dashboard.php` — Removed unused get_activity_id() method
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/observer/attendance_observer.php` — Added session message size limit
- `local_sceh_rules/classes/rules/attendance_rule.php` — Added try-catch error handling
- `scripts/README.md` — Created documentation for script organization
- `scripts/config/` — Moved 23 configure_*.php scripts
- `scripts/verify/` — Moved 26 verify_*.php scripts
- `scripts/test/` — Moved 19 test and property test scripts
- `CONVENTIONS.md` — Updated to reflect Moodle PHP project instead of Django

## [2026-01-17] — Dashboard Block and Rules Engine

**Branch**: `front-end-explorations`

### What changed
- Created SCEH Dashboard block plugin with role-based cards
- Implemented Rules Engine for attendance and roster automation
- Added Kirkpatrick Level 4 ROI tracking plugin
- Created unified Kirkpatrick dashboard for Levels 1-3

### Why
Fellowship programs needed a unified navigation interface and automated rule enforcement for attendance-based competency access. Kirkpatrick evaluation framework required consolidated dashboard for training effectiveness measurement.

### Files touched
- `block_sceh_dashboard/` — Complete dashboard block plugin (7 trainee cards, 8 admin cards)
- `local_sceh_rules/` — Rules engine with attendance and roster automation
- `local_kirkpatrick_level4/` — ROI calculation and organizational impact tracking
